Goal: Track an object with Pixy and have a pan/tilt mount + car 
it's mounted on follow a target through an arduino.

Servos:
Pan (Pin 9/Orange): Center = 100, right = 10, left = 200
Tilt (Pin 10/White): Center = 180, up = 90, down = N/A

Steering/Motor:
Motor (Pin 11)
Steering Servo (Pin 12)

Laser:
Laser (Pin 13)

Use block-based following: If object in the left third of the screen, 
move turret left at a slow, constant speed. If in the right third,
move right at a slow, constant speed. If in top third, etc.

To debug, output all movements to serial.
